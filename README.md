# Polished Planning Poker

A (polished) planning poker web app.

Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker):

> **Planning poker**, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile principles. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.

This project objective is to build a **Planning Poker Web App** using the following technologies:

1. Typescript with Jest
2. ReactJS on the client side
3. NodeJS + Express on the server side
4. MongoDB for database manipulation
5. Socket.io to add real-time communication between the users

This project is a refactorization of a planning poker app I have developed in the past, hence the adjective "polished". The old code is on [this](https://github.com/gus-dev-team/planning-poker) repository. This time I will used Test Driven Development (TDD) techniques alongside SOLID and CLEAN coding principles.
